# Virtual Drag and Drop - Hand Gesture Interaction

Virtual Drag and Drop is an exciting Python project that leverages computer vision and hand gesture recognition to enable users to interact with virtual objects through natural hand movements. This project utilizes the power of the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and gesture detection, coupled with OpenCV for real-time image processing.

## Key Features

- **Hand Tracking:** The application accurately tracks the user's hand in real-time, detecting landmarks and fingertip positions to recognize hand gestures.
- **Drag and Drop:** Users can intuitively drag and drop virtual objects on the screen using their index finger tip.
- **Multi-Object Interaction:** The project supports the interaction with multiple virtual objects simultaneously, enhancing the user experience.
- **Customizable Detection Threshold:** The detection confidence level can be adjusted to cater to various hand movement styles and lighting conditions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The project is designed to run smoothly on various platforms, offering flexibility and accessibility.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python script to initiate the application.
2. Ensure your camera is accessible to allow real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
3. Move your hand in front of the camera, and the application will detect your hand's landmarks and track its position.
4. Bring your index finger tip close to a virtual object and join it with middle finger to select it for dragging.
5. Bring your index and middle finger apart to drop the object .


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python script `main.py` to start the application.
